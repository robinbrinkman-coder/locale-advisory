      <h1>About Locale Advisory</h1>
      <p>
        Locale Advisory is an independent tenant representation and leasing
        advisory practice focused on aligning workplaces with how people
        actually work.
      </p>
      <p>
        We sit solely on the tenant side, providing data-led search, clear
        advice on total occupancy cost, and structured negotiations that
        protect flexibility and downside.
      </p>
